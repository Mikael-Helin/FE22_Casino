--- version_0.0.1

For last week, the solution by John chosen as the final solution, it is easy to follow and it is the "MVP" asked.

--- version_0.0.2

From now on, we will always add the html, head, body and other "broiler plate" tags.

The next task is the following.

1. Post an issue you want fixed. The posting is done in Github.
Goto https://github.com/Mikael-Helin/FE22_Casino/issues

2. Fix an issue posted by someone else. (No Bootstrap allowed yet!).
When you begin fix an issue, open another branch first.

3. If someone solved your issue without Bootstrap, then mark it fixed/solved/whatever.
Remember, you are the owner of your own issues, which your friends fix for you.

4. Feel free to merge your solved issue into the main branch.

Example:

Mikael - says "I want a padded border around the input field for name in register.html".
John - Creates a new branch, adds the requested border.
Mikael - finds the solution by John fixed, then Mikael merges Johns branch into the main branch.
