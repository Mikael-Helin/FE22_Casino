Let us pretend we have a Casino from Las Vegas as our stakeholder.

I want you to do minimal work to complete a few tasks.
Please, do not make this example beautiful or advanced, we just keep it simple.

Your solution may be incomplete, we will tidy it together later another time. For
example, there is no <head> and <body> or <title> tags in the HTML. Let us at this
moment run at bare minimum as much as we can. We work on MVP. 

A minimum viable product (MVP) is a version of a product with just enough features
to be usable by early customers who can then provide feedback for future product
development.
